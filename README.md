## Specification
3.js is a high level JavaScript library that collects 3D abstractions that are
likely to be used in a Slye module or it self in one place.

The required library must be able to provide an API with a presentation and also
provide a UI abstraction to be used in Slye frontends.

All of the provided API must be as cross platform as possible.

Slye modules are WebAsm file so that they can not effect the userland directly.
